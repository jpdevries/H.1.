# H.1.
> WIP. HTML-first Sauce for Web Components

**H.1.** is a collection of research, development, PoCs, and actualized web components arhictected with HTML&ndash;first in mind. By initially wireframing components and concepting their core experiences we allow ourselves the best chances of keeping our components framework&ndash;agnostic as they become actualized. This means that developers should be able to switch between VanillaJS, React, and AngularJS implementations of a component with no indication to the user anything has been&nbsp;changed. The libraries or frameworks we may or may not use to enhance our components should be irrelevant to end users.

A multitude of drivers makes individual components more portable. For example, the [Eurkea Media Browser component](https://github.com/jpdevries/eureka) was originally scripted using VanillaJS so that it could be lightweight. When used on a VanillaJS project EurekaJS is as lightweight as can be. However, when used within an AngularJS project the 64kb of minified JavaScript that makes up the scripts for Eureka becomes bloated. This is because if AngularJS were leveraged by Eureka much of the 64kb of script would no longer be needed. This is why components are architected with an extendable core that can be enhanced with any number of drivers. In an ideal world, each of our components would have at least one advocate of the associated framework who is responsible for keeping their driver up to date and supported.
